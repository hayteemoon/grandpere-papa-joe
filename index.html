Toward the latter years of his life, the reverend was surrounded by immediate family. Loving the LORD, he was entrusted with an abundant family lineage of sons, daughters, grandsons, granddaughters. Pastor Joseph Aniel Angerville passed away in an Orlando, Florida hospice care facility called AdventHealth on May 26, 2025. Fortunately enough, he was entombed beside his wife, Marie C.
